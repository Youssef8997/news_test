# Offline-First Mobile App with New York Times API

## Overview

This project builds a mobile application that consumes the New York Times (NYT) API to display a list of articles. It implements an offline-first approach, allowing users to access articles even when they're offline. The app stores articles locally for offline viewing and includes functionality to sync articles in the background when the device is online. It also handles conflicts that may arise when the local and remote data differ. Articles are displayed with their headlines, summaries, and images, and users can read full articles when online or offline.
